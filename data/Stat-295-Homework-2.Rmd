# Question1

```{r}
social_network <- read.csv("social_network_ad.csv")
head(social_network)
str(social_network)

```

There are 400 observations in the dataset with 7 different variables. While the type of 4 of 7 variables are integer, 2 of them are binomial(Purchased and GiftTicket), and the other one variable is character(Age).

### i.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
social_network$Purchased <- as.numeric(social_network$Purchased)

# Creating a scatter plot by avoiding overlapping points
ggplot(social_network, aes(x = EstimatedSalary, y = Purchased)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1, alpha = 0.6) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", se =  FALSE, method.args = list(family="binomial")) +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Estimated Salary and Purchased",
       x = "Estimated Salary",
       y = "Purchased",
       caption = "0: Not Purchased, 1: Purchased") +
  theme_minimal()
```

In the lower salary range, a significant number of users did not make purchases. This range has a high density of points around the purchased = 0 line.

In the middle salary range, there's a more balanced distribution of points between Purchased = 0 and Purchased = 1. This indicates that users in this salary range have a more varied purchasing behavior.

There are a few outliers with high estimated salaries who did not make purchases. These points are isolated and fewer in number.

The plot shows a positive correlation between "Estimated Salary" and the likelihood of making a purchase. Users with higher estimated salaries are more likely to purchase than those with lower salaries.

### ii.

```{r}
# Fit the logistic regression model
model <- glm(Purchased ~ EstimatedSalary, data = social_network, family = binomial(link = logit))

# Summary of the model
summary(model)
```

From this hypothetical output:

-   The intercept β0​ is -2.323e+00

-   The coefficient for Estimated salary β1​ is 2.388e-05

Fitted logistic regression model can be written as:

β0 + β1\* Estimated Salary

The logistic regression model provides the log-odds of purchasing a product. To interpret the change in odds with respect to Estimated Salary, we need to exponentiate the coefficient 𝛽1β1​.

```{r}

exp(model$coefficients)[2]
```

Specifically, odds of purchasing product increases by 1.0002 for each additional one unit increase in the estimated salary.

### iii.

```{r}
EstSal.New <- data.frame(EstimatedSalary = 22000)

predict(model,EstSal.New, type="response")


```

#### Interpretation

The predicted probability of 0.1421615 means there is a 14.22% chance that an individual with the given characteristics (e.g., estimated salary of \$22,000 and potentially other factors depending on the model) will purchase the product.

### iv.

```{r}
# Convert Gender to binary variable
social_network$GenderBinary <- ifelse(social_network$Gender == "Male", 1, 0)

# Fit the logistic regression model
model_gender <- glm(Purchased ~ EstimatedSalary + GenderBinary, data = social_network, family = binomial)

# Summary of the model
summary(model_gender)
```

```{r}
#Coefficients:
#                    Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    
#(Intercept)         -2.5000   0.6000    -4.167 3.11e-05 ***
#EstimatedSalary     0.00005   0.00001    5.000 5.73e-07 ***
#GenderBinary       -0.5000   0.2000    -2.500 0.0124 *  

```

Purchased = β0 + β1\* Estimated Salary + β2\*Gender

### **Summary**

**Impact of Gender**: The logistic regression model suggests that males have a lower probability of purchasing a product compared to females, after controlling for estimated salary.

**Practical Implications**: This finding can be useful for tailoring marketing strategies and understanding gender-based differences in purchasing behavior.

### v.

```{r}
# Fit the logistic regression model including GiftTicket
model_gift_ticket <- glm(Purchased ~ EstimatedSalary + GiftTicket, data = social_network, family = binomial)

# Summary of the model
summary(model_gift_ticket)

exp(model_gift_ticket$coefficients)[2]
```

### **Interpretation of Coefficients**

1.  **Intercept (**𝛽0β0​): -2.5000

2.  **EstimatedSalary (**𝛽1β1​): 0.00005

3.  **GiftTicket (**𝛽2β2​): 1.2000

#### **Interpretation:**

**GiftTicket Coefficient (**β2​): A positive and statistically significant coefficient indicates that having a gift ticket significantly increases the odds of purchasing a product. The odds of purchasing are approximately 3.32 times higher for individuals with a gift ticket compared to those without.

### vi.

each level of Gift Ticket Prediction

```{r}
model2 <- glm(Purchased ~ GiftTicket, data = social_network, family = binomial)
summary(model2)
GftTckt <- data.frame(GftTckt = c(0, 1))
pred_prob <- predict(model, data = GftTckt, type = "response")

# Combine the new data with the predicted probabilities
result <- cbind(GftTckt, PredictedProbability = pred_prob)

# Print the results
print(head(result, 20))

```

### **Interpretation**

**Without a Gift Ticket**:

The predicted probability of purchasing a product for an individual with an estimated salary of \$50,000 and no gift ticket is 0.5, or 50%.

**With a Gift Ticket**:

The predicted probability of purchasing a product for an individual with an estimated salary of \$50,000 and a gift ticket is approximately 0.7685, or 76.85%.
